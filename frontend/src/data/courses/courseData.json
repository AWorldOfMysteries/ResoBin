    "CourseCredit": "6",
    "CourseDescription": "Historical overview of Chemical Engineering: Concepts of unit operations and unit processes, and more recent developments, Features of organized chemical processing- from chemistry to chemical engineering. The Chemical Industry-scope, features & characteristics. and scope. Principles of balancing with examples to illustrate differential and integral balances, lumped and distributed balances. Material balances in simple systems involving physical changes and chemical reactions; systems involving recycle, purge. and bypass. Properties of substances: single component & multi-component, single and multiphase systems. Use of Compressibility charts, vapour pressure correlations/charts & Psychometric charts. Ideal liquid and gaseous mixtures. Energy balance calculations in simple systems. Introduction to Computer aided calculations-steady state material and energy balances.",
